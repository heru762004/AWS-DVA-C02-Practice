2. A mobile game has a serverless backend consisting of an API Gateway backed by Lambda functions and a DynamoDB table in provisioned capacity mode, where player data is stored. While the game has maintained a consistent level of traffic, recent growth in the player base has caused response times to slow down. To improve performance, the developer wants to reduce the number of database queries for data that rarely change. What approach can the developer take to achieve this goal cost-effectively and with less development overhead?

    - A. Create an Amazon MemoryDB for Redis database in front of the DynamoDB table to cache data.
    - B. Use DynamoDB Session Handler to handle the saving and retrieval of player data.
    - C. Switch the DynamoDB table’s capacity mode to On-demand.
    - D. Set up an Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) caching layer in front of the DynamoDB table.
